A simple twitter bot for creating a Newsfeed from the Github repositories which is shared by Persian developer community
based on [twitter4j libarary](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html).

I built it with maven and deployed on Heroku without IDE. Maybe Eclipse or Netbeans can't recognize the project.

[Here](http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html) you can find some ways for configuring Twitter4J. In this project, I choosed the last one.
